I am not going to repeat that. I want to derive the formulas from scratch entirely.
I also understand that comprehending this stuff is slightly challenging if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong mathematics background.
Note: All of my notation is from Bishop’s book.
The main difference between Bayesian and Non-Bayesian regression is that Bayesian regression assumes that weights are Random variables.</description></item><item><title>Why Socialism?</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/posts/socialism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 1949 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/posts/socialism/</guid><description>Source: Monthly Review, May 1949
Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.
Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible.</description></item><item><title>First blog</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/posts/welcome/</guid><description>Add the stuff here.

The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.
Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
